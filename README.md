# AgileFlow

## Description

AgileFlow is a Go-based project dedicated to cryptography research, implementation, and the development of security analysis tooling. This repository serves as a central hub for exploring various cryptographic algorithms, providing practical implementations, and offering tools to assess their security properties. Our goal is to facilitate both theoretical understanding and practical application of cryptographic techniques, fostering a community of researchers, developers, and security professionals. We aim to provide high-quality, well-documented, and thoroughly tested cryptographic components and tools.

## Features

*   **Cryptographic Algorithm Implementations:** Provides robust and efficient Go implementations of various cryptographic algorithms, including symmetric-key ciphers (AES, ChaCha20), asymmetric-key ciphers (RSA, ECC), and hashing algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-3).

*   **Security Analysis Tools:** Offers tools for performing security analysis on cryptographic implementations, such as side-channel analysis, fuzzing, and formal verification.

*   **Benchmarking and Performance Analysis:** Includes tools for benchmarking cryptographic algorithms and analyzing their performance characteristics on different platforms.

*   **Modular Design:** The project is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration of new algorithms and tools.

*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provides detailed documentation for all implemented algorithms and tools, including usage examples and security considerations.
