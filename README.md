# AgileFlow

AgileFlow is a lightweight and extensible workflow engine written in Go, designed to simplify the management and execution of complex processes. It provides a flexible framework for defining workflows as code, enabling developers to automate tasks, orchestrate services, and build robust, event-driven applications. AgileFlow aims to improve developer productivity by offering a clear and concise way to model and execute workflows, reducing boilerplate and promoting maintainability.

## Description

AgileFlow empowers developers to define workflows as a series of interconnected tasks, each performing a specific function. These tasks can be chained together to create complex processes with conditional branching, parallel execution, and error handling. The engine provides a runtime environment for executing these workflows, tracking their progress, and managing their state. AgileFlow is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to define their own task types, data formats, and execution strategies. By using AgileFlow, teams can streamline their development processes, improve collaboration, and build more resilient and scalable applications. The core principle is configuration as code, enabling version control, testing, and automated deployment of workflows.

## Features

*   **Workflow Definition as Code:** Define workflows using Go code, providing type safety, version control, and testability.
*   **Extensible Task System:** Implement custom task types to integrate with various services and APIs, tailoring the engine to specific needs.
*   **Conditional Branching and Parallel Execution:** Model complex workflows with conditional logic and parallel task execution for increased efficiency.
*   **Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:** Implement robust error handling strategies with automatic retries and fallback mechanisms.
*   **Workflow State Management:** Track the progress of workflows and manage their state, enabling monitoring and debugging.

## Installation

To install AgileFlow and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Go:** Ensure you have Go installed and configured correctly. You can download the latest version from the official Go website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
2.  **Set up your Go workspace:** If you haven't already, set up your Go workspace by defining the `GOPATH` environment variable.
3.  **Clone the repository:** Clone the AgileFlow repository to your local machine:
    
4.  **Download dependencies:** Use the `go mod` command to download the required dependencies:
    
5.  **Verify installation:** Run the example workflow to ensure that AgileFlow is installed correctly:
    
    This should execute a simple workflow and print the results to the console.

## Usage

Here are some example code snippets demonstrating how to use AgileFlow:



This example demonstrates a simple workflow with two tasks that print messages to the console.  To define a more complex workflow with conditional branching, you can use the `AddConditionalTransition` method:



These examples illustrate the basic usage of AgileFlow. You can extend these examples to create more complex workflows with custom task types and execution strategies.
